# simple-gulp-setup v2

Simple-gulp-setup v1 provided a simple gulpfile.babel.js to copy, along with instructions on how to setup and install the required dependencies. Version 2 simplifies this process by providing wrapper functions and a command line interface to set everything up automatically.

**Note: Version 2 is currently under development**
